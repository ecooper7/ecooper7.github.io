    <h3>About</h3>

    I completed the Ph.D. degree at Columbia University in the City of New York in 2019 with a research focus on text-to-speech synthesis for low-resource languages. I worked at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan from February 2019 - March 2024 as a contributor on the JST-ANR CREST VoicePersonae project. 
    I am currently working at the <a href=https://www.nict.go.jp/en/index.html>National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)</a> in Kyoto, Japan.  My research interests include speech and audio processing and synthesis, 
    and I was a co-organizer of the VoiceMOS Challenge in <a href=https://voicemos-challenge-2022.github.io/>2022</a> and <a href=https://voicemos-challenge-2023.github.io/>2023</a>.
